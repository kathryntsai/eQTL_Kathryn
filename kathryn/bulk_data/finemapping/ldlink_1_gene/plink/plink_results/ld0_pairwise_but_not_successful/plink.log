418 (of 418) markers to be included from [ acbd6.map ]
Warning, found 1 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
These individuals will be set to missing ( or use --allow-no-sex )
Writing list of these individuals to [ plink.nosex ]
1 individuals read from [ acbd6.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 1 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 1 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 418 SNPs
1 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 418 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 1 missing
